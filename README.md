# Note Taker

## Description

The Note Taker application is a simple note-taking tool that allows users to write, save, and delete notes. This application is designed to help small business owners or any user organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks. It uses an Express.js back end to handle data saving and retrieval from a JSON file. The front end is already created, and the main focus of this project is building the back end to connect with the existing user interface.
